# WGMS Win Report — Conversion Pattern Library

## How to Use This File

Identify which pattern(s) match the ticket, then use the framing phrases below for the opening paragraph.

---

## Pattern 1: Presale → License → WGMS

**What it looks like:**
- Customer first asks pre-purchase questions about Duplicator or migration
- Agent answers + plants WGMS as the professional option
- Customer buys Duplicator Pro license
- Customer then purchases WGMS (same or follow-up ticket)

**Opening arc phrase:**
"from a presale to pro license + wgms [size] package conversion"
"from an initial migration inquiry to pro license + wgms sale"

**Email labels:**
- 1st email: Agent answers presale questions + introduces WGMS
- 2nd email: Customer buys license / asks more questions
- Last attempt / closing email: Agent closes WGMS sale

**Key strategic notes:**
- Credibility-building is critical in the 1st reply — the customer hasn't committed to anything yet
- License requirement should be framed as professional tool, not gatekeeping
- Price range should be introduced early (audit + range, not final quote) to anchor expectations

---

## Pattern 2: DIY Failure → WGMS

**What it looks like:**
- Customer already has Duplicator Pro and tried to migrate themselves
- Hit errors (path errors, installer failures, DB issues)
- Agent helps troubleshoot + pivots to WGMS
- Customer purchases WGMS to finish the job

**Opening arc phrase:**
"from a failed DIY migration to wgms [size] sale"
"from a stuck migration to a full wgms [size] package conversion"
"how a customer's self-migration attempt became a wgms [size] win"

**Email labels:**
- 1st email: Diagnose error + provide fix + embed WGMS upsell at bottom
- Customer email: Reports back (still stuck / tried the fix / more errors)
- Last attempt: Pivot fully to WGMS — done-for-you framing

**Key strategic notes:**
- Answer the technical question FIRST — always
- The upsell is positioned as relief, not pressure
- If customer is frustrated with time spent, urgency mirror is powerful
- WGMS30 discount is often the closer here

## Pattern 3: Support Request → WGMS (Cold Pivot)

**What it looks like:**
- Customer comes in with a general migration error or question
- They haven't tried WGMS or asked about it
- Agent identifies a WGMS trigger case (restricted host, large site, deadline, eCommerce)
- Converts a standard support ticket into a sale

**Opening arc phrase:**
"from a standard support request to a wgms [size] sale"
"how I spotted a wgms opportunity in a regular support ticket"
"from error troubleshooting to wgms [size] package conversion"

**WGMS trigger signals to note in the report:**
- Tight deadline / host shutdown mentioned
- WooCommerce / live transactions at risk
- Restricted host (WPEngine, GoDaddy, WordPress.com)
- Large backup / complex architecture
- Customer expressed frustration with repeated failures

**Key strategic notes:**
- The sale opportunity is usually NOT obvious at first read
- The report should highlight WHY this was a WGMS case (trigger signal)
- The upsell framing should emphasize what the customer gets, not what they pay

---

## Pattern 4: Full Journey (Presale → License → DIY Fail → WGMS)

**What it looks like:**
- Multi-ticket journey: customer asked presale questions, bought a license, tried it themselves, failed, then bought WGMS
- Often the most complex and most teachable case
- May span multiple ticket numbers

**Opening arc phrase:**
"from first contact to pro license + wgms [size] — the full journey"
"how a presale question became a [size] wgms sale after a self-migration attempt"

**Email labels:**
- Multiple early emails for the presale and license phase
- A "Customer" email showing the DIY attempt
- The crisis / failure point
- Last attempt: The decisive WGMS close

**Key strategic notes:**
- The report should feel like a story with a clear turning point
- The "Last attempt email" section is especially important here — it's where the win was secured
- Highlight the patience and persistence of the approach

---

## Pattern 5: Rescue / Recovery WGMS

**What it looks like:**
- Customer already bought WGMS but migration went wrong
- Agent had to recover, troubleshoot, and re-deliver
- Still ends as a WIN (customer satisfied, review requested)

**Opening arc phrase:**
"how we recovered a failed wgms migration and turned it into a win"
"from a post-sale crisis to a completed [size] wgms delivery"

**Key strategic notes:**
- Focus on crisis management and communication strategy
- The "what I did different" section should highlight how the customer was shielded from complexity
- Trust-building through transparency post-resolution is the key lesson
